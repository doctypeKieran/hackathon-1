# TravelTrek

A Website created to assist Adventure Seekers in finding their next destination.

Although a Travel Guide Website, we have biased it towards those looking to experience different cultures, history, landscapes and adventures to go on.

## Project Setup

### Persona and User Stories
#### Persona

Adventure Seeker:

- Age: 20-35

- Goals: To explore new places and experience different cultures

#### User Stories

These are the user stories which we decided on.  The ones in **BOLD** are the ones which we decided to be in scope for our project.

#### GitHub Projects

After completing ideation and producing user stories - as well as agreeing on which ones were in scope - we set up a GitHub projects board detailing the user stories in the Backlog.  We also added *Global Site Features* (Navbar, Footer etc.), "Documentation" and "Bugs and Errors" into the Backlog.  Each item was numbered to correspond with features which we deemed to be "Ready" and "In Progress".

#### GitHub Issues

Using the Projects board, we created Issues (tickets) for each individual member to work through.  The issues addressed things such as features to address, responsiveness to test and bugs/errors to fix.

### Wireframing

We produced wireframes for each website page using Canva and uploaded them to our group chat for reference while laying out/styling each page.  Members worked on separate pages to avoid merge conflicts.  Communication was carried out thoroughly to ensure there would be no conflicts between each individual member's code.


### Styles and Layout

The UXD talked with the team to discuss potential colour schemes.  For a Travel Destination Site, the UXD proposed using bright, eye-catching colours with mixes of warmer, radiant colours to resemble scenery and sunsets.  We agreed on a colour palette which offers a dark teal, a lighter teal, a sunrise yellow, and a sunset red.  The colour palette can be viewed [here](https://palettes.shecodes.io/palettes/42#palette).


## Features

### Navigation bar

- The layout of the Navbar was agreed upon during the wireframing stage and then implemented by the Front-End Developer.

- Styles were added to the Navbar as well as working links for each page.

### Searchbar

A searchbar was added to the Navbar, a feature which would allow users to search for their ideal destination, places to visit, historical landmarks, etc.  The searchbar is present for aesthetic purposes and has no functionality.

### Carousel

A carousel was agreed to be a good idea for attracting users on their first visit to the sight.  A transitioning range of scenic, captivating images would provide first-time users an insight of what the site has to offer.

### Alert banner

An alert banner was agreed to sit on top of the carousel, providing users with information that a deal was currently available.  Using bright colours and centered and bold text, users would be drawn to the information whilst maintaining the colour scheme and overall visual appeal of the site.

### Footer

A Bootstrap footer was implemented into each page containing information such as contact information, socials icons and copyright text.  The colours were adjusted to remain in conjunction with the agreed colour palette.

## Website Pages

### Home Page

- Features a carousel as the first attraction point for a user, displaying images of five popular landmarks and descriptive text.

- Has an alert banner 

### Destinations page

- Contains a feature image with overlaying text.  Below that, a card layout split into categories (Sports, Food & Traditions, etc.)

- Contains a non-functional filter/checklist so users would be able to narrow down what they're searching for.

### What To Do page


### Packages & Deals page

- Features another non-functional filter/checklist which would allow users to sort the displayed choices in a filtered price range.

- Contains a card layout displaying the desired package choices to the user (by standard, a group of cards with hard-coded data).

Sharing some available packages provided by the website that are tailored to suit our target audience that some are heavily cultural and some are heavily adrenaline based, with some more balanced than others.

- Carousel
Created for easy access off the bat for the user to assist in their search for what they want.

- Responsive / Reactive Layout
having a reactive and responsive layout is always good to take a website a step futher for user convinience and access.
