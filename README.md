# TravelTrek

A Website created to assist Adventure Seekers in finding their next destination.

Although a Travel Guide Website, we have biased it towards those looking to experience different cultures, history, landscapes and adventures to go on.

#### GitHub Projects

After completing ideation and producing user stories - as well as agreeing on which ones were in scope - we set up a GitHub projects board detailing the user stories in the Backlog.  We also added *Global Site Features* (Navbar, Footer etc.), "Documentation" and "Bugs and Errors" into the Backlog.  Each item was numbered to correspond with features which we deemed to be "Ready" and "In Progress".

#### GitHub Issues

Using the Projects board, we created Issues (tickets) for each individual member to work through.  The issues addressed things such as features to address, responsiveness to test and bugs/errors to fix.

### Wireframing

We produced wireframes for each website page using Canva and uploaded them to our group chat for reference while laying out/styling each page.  Members worked on separate pages to avoid merge conflicts.  Communication was carried out thoroughly to ensure there would be no conflicts between each individual member's code.


### Styles and Layout

The UXD talked with the team to discuss potential colour schemes.  For a Travel Destination Site, the UXD proposed using bright, eye-catching colours with mixes of warmer, radiant colours to resemble scenery and sunsets.  We agreed on a colour palette which offers a dark teal, a lighter teal, a sunrise yellow, and a sunset red.  The colour palette can be viewed [here](https://palettes.shecodes.io/palettes/42#palette).


## Features

### Navigation bar
![Navigation bar](https://i.ibb.co/pPG3wDF/readme-ss-2.png)

- The layout of the Navbar was agreed upon during the wireframing stage and then implemented by the Front-End Developer.

- Styles were added to the Navbar as well as working links for each page.

### Searchbar

![Search bar](https://i.ibb.co/5R5nsR3/readme-ss-3.png)

A searchbar was added to the Navbar, a feature which would allow users to search for their ideal destination, places to visit, historical landmarks, etc.  The searchbar is present for aesthetic purposes and has no functionality.

### Alert banner

![Alert banner](https://i.ibb.co/J283X5r/readme-ss-4.png)

An alert banner was agreed to sit on top of the carousel, providing users with information that a deal was currently available.  Using bright colours and centered and bold text, users would be drawn to the information whilst maintaining the colour scheme and overall visual appeal of the site.

### Booking Form

![](https://i.ibb.co/jzXdhTw/readme-ss.png)

A booking form was added below the alert banner so that users could book a quick holiday should they desire to.  The booking form is contained in an eye-catching banner drawing the user to it on their first visit to the page.

### Carousel

![Carousel of images](https://i.ibb.co/Y0sYzsQ/readme-ss-5.png)

A carousel was agreed to be a good idea for attracting users on their first visit to the sight.  A transitioning range of scenic, captivating images would provide first-time users an insight of what the site has to offer.

### Cards

![Card layout](https://i.ibb.co/WGT3wys/readme-ss-6.png)

Card components were a key feature of our website, displaying information in a sleek and accessible collection of cards which contained data for holidays, destinations, activities, etc.

### Filters

![List of filters](https://i.ibb.co/WtjvRhx/readme-ss-7.png)

Filters were implemented into the website so that users would be able to filter and narrow down choices, therefore making it simpler for a user to find precisely what they're looking for within a selected display of options.

### Footer

![Footer with details](https://i.ibb.co/Xp4F2hL/readme-ss-8.png)

A Bootstrap footer was implemented into each page containing information such as contact information, socials icons and copyright text.  The colours were adjusted to remain in conjunction with the agreed colour palette.

## Website Pages
